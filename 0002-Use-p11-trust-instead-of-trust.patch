Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Use p11-trust instead of trust.

Clear Linux provides a stub instead of 'trust' to avoid using it for
trust store management. The native p11-kit 'trust' command is provided
as 'p11-trust' instead.

This change:

* Adds 'trust-stub'.
* Changes 'trust' invocation in p11-kit to 'p11-trust'.

NB: The build instals 'trust-stub' as 'trust'. And 'trust' as
'p11-trust' in the package.
